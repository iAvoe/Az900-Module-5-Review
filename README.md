# Az900-Module-5-Review

## Identity

### Authentication vs Authorization
- Authentication verifies identity and credentials
- Authorization verifies level of access

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Username (identity)
- Password (credentials)
- Keys (certificate or personal questions)

### Azure Entra (Azure Active Directory / AAD)
- A cloud-based identity and access management service
- *Authentication*: Employees' sign-in
- *Single sign-on (SSO)*
- *Application management*
- *Business to Business (B2B)*
- *Business to Customer (B2C) identity services*
- *Device Management*

### Conditional Access
- If a user wants to access a resource, then they must complete an action by detection:
  - User or Group Membership
  - IP Location
  - Device Type
  - Application
  - Real-time risk detection
- i.e.: A user wants to access an app like Microsoft 365 --> must perform MFA

- A fine-grained access management that inherits Active Directory
- Segragate duties by:
  - User-groups
  - Apps
  - Individual-user
